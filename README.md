# Carbon FP

Welcome to Carbon FP! I created this app in Django to help spread awareness of climate change in my country and help the community lessen their carbon footprint. By asking a few questions, this website helps people figure out how much carbon they have produced by traveling, consuming food, spending money, etc. during a year. It also provides information on what each individual can personally do to lessen their
carbon emissions.

You can access the website <a href="https://carbonfp.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.
